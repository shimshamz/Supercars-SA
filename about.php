            <h2>What cars mean to Us</h2> 
            <p class="quote italics">Not many people understand my absolute love for cars, to some people it's materialistic of me and to others it is just a phase that will pass, but cars are so much more than that. A joy ride will give me a greater high than any drug. Selling my car would be the worst heart break imaginable and a new car would be my new love that could fix my heart break. The cars I have test driven are the ones that got away, and my first car will always be my first love that holds a special place in my heart. A long drive will always be my best therapy and a car guy/girl will always be my best friend. My Italia will always be my dream girl, and being a race car driver will always be my dream. To the few people who really know me or really know a true love for cars, you know how I feel, and you know that I can't explain this kind of a love because it's something that can only be felt. <br>- The Founder</p>

            <h3 class="center">We are different people, from different backgrounds, all united by our love for cars.</h3>
